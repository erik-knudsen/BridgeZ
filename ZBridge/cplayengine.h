 * @brief Play engine.
 *
 * The next card to play is determined as follows:\n
 *   - Calculate a number of possible hand distributions based on remaining cards to play
 *     and on the players signals as defined by the user.
 *   - Solve these hands using double dummy algoritms (Bo Haglund, Soren Hein, Bob Richardson: DDS v. 2.8).
 *   - Select the best card to play based on this.\n
