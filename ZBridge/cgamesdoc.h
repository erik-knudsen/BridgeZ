/**
 * @brief This class implements the handling for a set of bridge games (including results).
 *
 * The class handles reading and writing of pbn files with bridge games. It can also generate random bridge games.
 * It stores data for the games in an internal format.\n
 * There are three types of games:
 *   - Already played games read from a pbn file. There are called original games. If the games are random
 *     generated (by this program), then there are no original games.
 *   - Games played manually by the user in cooperation with this program. They are called played games.
 *   - Games played automatically by this program. They are called auto games.
 * When data is saved, only played and auto games are saved.\n
 * There are two types of game sets:
 *   - Original games as read from a pbn file.
 *   - Random generated (by this program) games.
