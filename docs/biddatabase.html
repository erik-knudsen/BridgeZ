<h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 204);">Bid
Database.</span></h1>
<p><big>The intention of the bid database is </big><big>to
identify the best next bid</big><big>.
This is based on&nbsp;selected conventions, </big><big>the
auction
(bidding sequence) till now</big><big> and the given hand
(13 cards).
<br><br>
The database has three
levels:<br>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;The first level (page)
selects a top level of rules, based on selected conventions. The first
level is a one to one
mapping (injective).</li>
<br>
<li>The second level (auction)
delimits the rules in the top level set, to rules relevant for
a given auction (bidding
sequence). The second level is also a one to one mapping.&nbsp;</li>
<br>
<li>The third level (next bid)
further delimits the rules to one rule based on the hand (13 card)
features
(High card points etc.) and
in some cases also to selected conventions. The selected rule
identifies the next bid. The
third level is a one to many mapping (the next bid can be selected
by more than one rule).
In some cases the third
level instead identifies a substitute auction (sequence of bids).
It might also happen that
the database cannot find a best next bid. In which case the computer
uses an algoritmic approach for finding the next bid.</li>
</ul>
<br>
In the following dialogs you can create/examine the bid database.
</big></p>
<h3>Bidding System.</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 60px;"><img src="images/biddingsystem.png" style="width: 350px; height: 237px;" alt="Bidding System"><br>
</div>
<p><big>The "Pages" box allows you to create or examine or
edit or delete a page, the first level of the bid database.&nbsp;</big><big>The
Page Id identifies the page and is used by the bidding
algorithms for including or excluding the page in the determination of
the next bid.</big><big> A textual
description of the page is also shown for examination or for editing:
</big></p>
<div style="margin-left: 70px;"><img src="images/pagedescription.png" style="width: 300px; height: 131px;" alt="Page Description"><br>
</div>
<br>
<p><big>The "Auctions" box in the "Bidding System" dialog allows you to create or examine
or edit or delete an auction, the second level of the bid database.
<br>
The "Link" box allows you to create or examine or edit or delete a link
(a substitute auction). If an auction on the second level has a link to
another auction then the link is substituted for the original auction. <br>
The "Rules" box allows you to create or examine or edit or delete a
next bid, the third level of the bid database.
<br>
<br>
The rules are described by the following dialogs.</big></p>
<h3><big>Rule.</big></h3>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 50px;"><img src="images/rule.png" style="width: 400px; height: 378px;" alt="Rule">
<br>
</div>
<p><big>Here parameters for the rule is shown and can be
edited. <br>
The Rule Id identifies the rule and is used by the bidding
algorithms for including or excluding the rule in the determination of
the next bid. A Rule Id of 0 means that it is always included.<br>
The Rule
Priority is used when a number of rules are chosen by the bidding
algorithm as equal valid. The rule with the highest priority is then
chosen. In cases where the Rule Id is not 0 you can write a textual
description of the rule in the Rule Id Description box.&nbsp;
<br>
The Alert Id identifies the alert and must be not 0 for rules which
must be alerted. In cases where the Alert Id is not 0 you can write a
textual description of the alert in the Alert Id Description box.
</big></p>
<h3>High Cards and Quality.</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 50px;"><img src="images/highcardsandquality.png" style="width: 400px; height: 378px;" alt="High Cards abd Quality"><br ="">
</div>
<br>
<p><big>Range for High Cards and Quality can be defined in
this dialog. Range is defined for each suit. S for Spades, H for
Hearts, D for Diamonds, C for Clubs and A for all. Range is defined as
[from]-[to], [from]+ or +[to]. Where [from] and [to] are numbers. The
number is included in the range.

with suits first and all second):
<ul>
<li>HCP, weight of High Cards. Ace counts 4, King counts 3,
Queen counts 2, Jack counts 1. Range [0-10], [0-37].</li>

<li>Looser, loosers. Only the first three cards in the suit are
potential losers. Ace King and Queen are not loosers. Range [0-3],
[0-12]</li>
<li>Quick, quick tricks. Only Ace, King and Queen counts. Range [0-4], [0-16]. Multiplied with 2.</li>
<li>Play, playing tricks.&nbsp; Range [0-26]. Multiplied with 2.</li>

<li>Qlty, general quality of cards for a given suit. Range
[0-6].</li>
<li>Points, HCP + distribution points + lenght points. Range
[0-37], [0-37].</li>
<li>Dist, distribution points. Double counts 1, single counts
2, renonce counts 3. Range [0-9][0-9].</li>
</ul>
</big></p>
<h3>Length.</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 50px;"><img src="images/length.png" style="width: 400px; height: 378px;" alt="Lenght"></div>
<br>
<p><big>This dialog shows length ranges, which are
straightforward. The "Longest" column in the "Length" box is 1 if the
suit is the longest, 0 otherwise. The "Long" column in the "Length" box
is 1 if the suit is not the shortest. The parameters in the Other box:<br>
<ul>
<li>Balanced, 0 = balanced, 9 = freak.</li>
<li>Longer Than 3, number of suits longer than 3.</li>
<li>Longer Major, length of longest major.</li>
<li>Longer Minor, lenght of longest minor.</li>
</ul>
