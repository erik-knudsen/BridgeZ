Cards Manually.</span></h1>
<p><big>The Card Layout Dialog lets you quickly place cards
in players hands
during card layout mode. Click on a player in the top row of the
dialog, then check or uncheck card boxes to assign or clear cards from
that player's hand. You can also press "Clear Deal" to clear all the
cards in all hands. Or you can press "Deal Remaining" to deal remaining
cards randomly.</big></p>

<br>
<p><big>You can select the dealer and the vulnerability in
the "Dealer" box and the "Vulnerability" box. It is possible to type
more than one board. The "Select" box helps you with that.</big></p>
