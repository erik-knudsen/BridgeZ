<h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 204);">Mainframe
Window.</span></h1>
<p><big>The Mainframe window shows the playing table as the
play
progresses during the auction and play phases of the play. Below is
shown an example of how it looks in the auction phase. The
auction is displayed on the right side of the screen and the cards in
the center of the screen. The auction dialog where the next bid is
chosen is shown on top of the mainframe window in the upper left part
of the screen.</big></p>

<br>
<p><big>You can obtain help to the next bid or play by choosing
"Hint" from the
"Game" menu or by pressing the space bar. The computer will then show
you how it would bid or play. If you hover the mouse over the bids
shown on the right part of the screen, then a pop up will show you the
rules for the bid and whether there was an alert for this bid. It is
also possible to restart the bid or the play or to undo a single bid or
play by using "Rebid", "Replay" or "Undo" from the <a href="game.html">"Game" menu</a>.</big></p><br>
