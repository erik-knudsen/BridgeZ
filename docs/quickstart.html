<body><h3><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quick Start</span></big></h3><big>If you already know the game of Bridge, here are the minimum instructions necessary to get you started playing Easy Bridge.<br><br></big><h3><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Playing a Practice Hand</span></big></h3><big>When
you start ZBridge the first time, you are&nbsp;in Practice Mode.&nbsp;
You can&nbsp;select &#8220;New Session&#8221; from the menu or from the toolbar to
deal a new hand, and you will automatically be taken through the
bidding and card play stages.&nbsp; Then upon completion of card play,
your duplicate scoring will be shown and a new hand will be dealt.<br><br></big><h3><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Playing a Rubber</span></big></h3><big>If
you want to play a rubber match, you must select Options from the menu
and then Game to show the Game dialog. In the Game dialog you select
the "Scoring" tab and then "Rubber Bridge".&nbsp;This will start a
scored rubber match.&nbsp; Hands will be dealt and played until one
side wins the rubber, at which point the total score will be tallied up.<br>You can check the rubber score at any time by pressing F12 or selecting &#8220;Score&#8221; from the menu.<br><br></big><h3><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Playing against the computer.</span></big></h3><big>The
score dialog mentioned above in "Playing a Rubber" has two more choices
you can select if you want to compare your play with what the computer
would do. One is with International Match Point (IMP) scoring and the
other is with Match Point (MP) scoring. At the end of the play the
scoretable shows your play against how the computer would play the
cards.<br><br></big><h3><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Re-Deal / Re-Bid / Re-Play</span></big></h3><big>You
can always deal a new hand by pressing F1, regardless of which mode you
are in.&nbsp; You can also return to the start of bidding with the
current hand by pressing F3.&nbsp; In addition, pressing F4 will return
you to the start of card play (i.e., just before the first trick).
These choices can also be selected from the menu or from the toolbar.<br><br></big><h3><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Options</span></big></h3><big>You
can select various options from the "Options" menu to change bidding
and play options.&nbsp; Experiment with different settings, and when
you are in the dialogs you can use What's This help to get an
explanation of what the various settings are for.<br><br></big><h3><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save/Load</span></big></h3><big>You can save the current hand and load saved hands using the &#8220;File&#8221; menu.</big><br></body></html>
