ZBridge is a program for bridge players who wants to play
bridge with the help of a computer. There can be from 0 to 4 human players. The
computer(s) plays the non human players. Players can be either local on the local
computer or remote on one or more remote computers. I started development of the
program because I was not satisfied with the (to my knowledge) existing
bridge programs with regard to their net abilities.
ZBridge is for Windows computers. Its companion ZBridgeE is for embedded computers (currently only Android). They use the same communication protocol i.e. they can play bridge with each other on the internet. 
Yakindu (ItemisCREATE) is used for modelling the states of the communication protocol.
Bridge bidding is implemented by means of a table. Bo Haglunds Double Dummy Solver is used for calculating the best card to play (version DDS 2.9.0).

The ZBridge software is covered by the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version3 (GPLv3).


Development environment is Qt with the use of Qt Creator as IDE.

Installation for ZBridge development:

1. Install GitHub Desktop (I do not use Qt Creators GIT functionality).
	Clone ZBridge to c:/projects/qt/BridgeZ/
	
2. Install ItemisCREATE. It is an Eclipse based program.
	Install UMLet in Eclipse.
	Import project ZBridge to Eclipse without copy (default)
	
3. Install Qt.
	Use the BridgeZ/ZBridge/build/ folder for qt debug and release builds.

4. Install DoxyGen
		Install Graphviz
		Install mscgen
		Set dot path in DoxyFile
                
5. The Double Dummy Solver by Bo Haglund is generated as a dll. the dll is in the
	bin folder (dds.dll). The Double Dummy Solver is also in the dds repository
	as a Qt projects and can be generated here. Copy dds.dll to
	c:/projects/qt/BridgeZ/ZBridge/ (library for the linker). After building the
	zbridge application, copy dds.ddl to the build directory (debug or release)
	to be used by the zbridge application (where the zbridge.exe file is located)
	
    The docs folder has help files used by the Qt help framework to generate help for ZBridge (qhelpgenerator zbridge.qhcp -o zbridge.qhc). zbridge.qch and zbridge.qhc should be copied to the build folder (debug/release).
	
6. Deploy zbridge by means of windployqt (uncomment shown lines in zbridge.pro).
	Deployed files will be generated in the bin folder in BridgeZ/ZBridge/.
	Copy missing dll's to this folder (dds.ddl,libgcc_s_seh-1.dll,
	libstdc++-6.dll and libwinpthread-1.dll). Also copy help files
	zbridge.qch	and zbridge.qhc to this folder.

7. Install Inno Setup (for generating a Windows installation file for the
	zbridge application).
	Copy the Inno Setup Script file zbridge.iss from BridgeZ/bin/ to
	BridgeZ/ZBridge/bin/.
	Open the script file in BridgeZ/Zbridge/bin/ and compile. The Windows
	installation file zbridge.exe will be generated in
	BridgeZ/ZBridge/bin/output/. Copy this file to BridgeZ/bin/.
