ZBridge is a program for bridge players who wants to play bridge with the help of a computer.
There can be from 0 to 4 human players. The computer plays the missing players. Players can
be either local on the local computer or remote on one or more remote computers.
I started development of the program because I was not satisfied with any of the existing
bridge programs with regard to their net abilities.
I have until now concentrated on the man machine interface and not payed must attention to
the computers automatic play capability. 
This is work in progress and still misses a lot.
